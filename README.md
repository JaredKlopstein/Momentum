# Momentum

A personal habit tracking tool designed to help build consistency through data, streaks, and progression.

This project will evolve over time:
- Phase 1: CLI habit tracker MVP
- Phase 2: Streaks, reminders & richer features
- Phase 3: API backend using FastAPI/Flask
- Phase 4: Web dashboard + deployment
- Phase 5: Stretch features (AI insights, notifications, etc.)

## Goals
- Build a real project end-to-end
- Practice Python fundamentals while leveling up gradually
- Share progress publicly (#BuildInPublic)
- Make something genuinely useful
